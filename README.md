# huggingface-tools

A collection of tools that I use. Sharing them here to give back in some way, shape or form.

## Scripts

- `get_datasets.py`
  - This is used to download datasets that I use on a regular basis.
  - This is handy when I am trying to build a new machine at home and I want to ensure I've got all my datasets.
- `model_manager.py`
  - This is used to download GGUF models from Hugging Face using the `huggingface_hub` python lib.
  - NOTE: If you are downloading protected models be sure you are authenticated with `huggingface_hub`
